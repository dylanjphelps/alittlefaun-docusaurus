# Commissions

I open for commissions a couple times a year and select 2-3 project per round. Quotes however, are always open and noncommittal - just fill out this form, send me a message on Twitter or Instagram!

Please do note that commissions are not first-come, first-served and I do have limitations on what I make. I do not make NSFW plush or extremely detailed characters (i.e. zebra strips).

## Process

### Payment

Payment is through PayPal invoice and can be paid either in full upfront or split into two payments - half prior to starting and the remainder plus shipping upon completion.

### Material and pattern confirmation

- Prior to the invoice, I will confirm the plush pattern to be used as well as fabric types/ colors.
- Materials that I have used in the past include (but are not limited to): minky fabric, faux fur, poly-fil, quilt batting, poly-pellets, magnets, foam, cotton fabrics, felt, fleece, and plastic or wire armature.
  Fabric order: Fabric usually takes one to two weeks to arrive.

### Face design

I will ask for your review on the face embroidery/design prior to embroidering and make any revisions needed. For the rest of the plush I will just follow the reference images that you send.

### Completion

Plushies generally take about 2 months to complete but I can't guarantee completion dates.

### Shipping

My default shipping method is USPS priority mail with insurance, tracking, and optionally, signed delivery. If you'd prefer a different shipping method, I can also that as long as it is available in my area and also includes insurance and tracking.

## Price Guide

Right now I offer commissions using premade plush pattern bases. Edits can be made for species specific head shape, wings, tongue, tail, etc. Below is a general guide but bot all patterns are listed below - if it's a plush I've made before or you have a purchasable plush pattern you'd like for me to use, I'm down!

At this point in time I am not creating custom pattern bases due to the amount of time I need invest into the process.
