# FAQ

If your question is not answered here, please feel free to send me a message!

### How is payment handled?

- Domestic Commissions (US) - In most cases, payment will be through a PayPal Invoice. If you live in Texas or in a state that I'm required to collect local sales tax, I'll send you a link to a listing on my Big Cartel shop. (Big Cartel collects and remits local sales taxes so I don't need to handle it myself.)
- International Commissions - I will create a private listing on Etsy and send the link to you. The price quote will be adjusted to account for Etsy fees.

### Do you make ... plushies?

As long as there is a pattern that I can purchase to use as a base I'm down to take a look! I enjoy tackling new patterns and sometimes do offer discounts if it's a pattern that I want to try out. My current interest is on CholyKnight's cuddle [pattern](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1365446930/cuddle-plush-animal-sewing-pattern-pdf). I do however have very limited experience with clothing which is also why do I've done very few humanoid plushies.

### Could you tell me more about your pricing?

The finished pictures of plushies you see are not the entire picture. I spend hours creating prototypes to get the right fabric pattern. This is material that doesn't go into the final plush. For a detailed breakdown see my [cost breakdown](https://github.com/alittlefaun/materials).

### How do you choose your commissions?

I choose projects that reflect my current skill level and interests. I don't take on extremely complex designs (zebra stripes, gradients, etc.) I might not have the needed equipment and I also don't want to do experiments while making a plush. Please don't be offended if you're not selected - sometimes I just don't feel I can do your OC justice.

### Do you offer payment plans?

Yes! If your commission quote is over $100, I can split it into two payments. Half upfront and half upon completion.

### Do you make NSFW plushies?

No.
