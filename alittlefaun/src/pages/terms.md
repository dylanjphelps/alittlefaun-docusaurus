# Terms and Conditions
Last updated April 20, 2023

A personalized copy of my Terms and Conditions will be attached to the PayPal invoice. This is a general version for you to read. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

**1. Age**: You are 18 years or older.

**2. Timeline**: Commissions take about 2 months after fabric arrival but a completion date is not guaranteed.

**3. Usage**: Plushies are intended for display purposes only and are not toys for children. Plushies will not stand up to use outside of intended purpose.

**4. Design**: Plushie face design is subject to client approval/ input. I can't guarantee 100% accuracy but will use my best effort.

**5. Payment and Shipping**: The quote for a commission plus shipping costs and any custom fees is due prior to shipping. Default shipping is via USPS with insurance, tracking, and optionally, signed delivery. I am not responsible for lost or damaged packages.

**7. Refunds/ Cancellations**: If a client cancels once any work has been started, the client forfeits half of the commission quote and the other half will be refunded. If I am unable to complete your commission for any reason, I will issue you a full refund.

**9. Rights**: I may use image of the plush for advertising.
