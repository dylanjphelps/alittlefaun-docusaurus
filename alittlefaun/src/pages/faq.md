            <blockquote>
                <p>
                Domestic Commissions (US) - In most cases, payment will be through a PayPal Invoice. If you live in Texas or in a state that I'm required to collect sales tax, I'll send you a link to a listing on my Big Cartel shop. (Big Cartel collects and remits local sales taxes so I don't need to handle it myself.)
                </p>
                <p>
                International Commissions - I will create a private listing on Etsy and send the link to you. The price quote may be adjusted to account for Etsy fees.
                </p>

                The finished pictures of plushies you see are not the entire picture. I spend hours creating prototypes to get the right fabric pattern. This is material that doesn't go into the final plush. Here's a breakdown of materials just off the top of my head:

                <p>
                I am just one person and unfortunately have limited time. Plushies might be beyond my skill level, have elements that I don't enjoy (excessive stripes, spots, etc.), or I just don't have the equipment to make them! I want to get a sublimation setup going but that's out of my budget right now and I also don't have the space where I live &gt;&#147;&lt;

                <p>
                I learned how to use a basic sewing machine as a child but only really had time to start making plushies about two years ago so I still feel like a newbie!
