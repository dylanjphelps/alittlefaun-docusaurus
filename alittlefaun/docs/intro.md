Hello there! ðŸŒ±

I'm alittlefaun - you can call me faun (ã€ƒÏ‰ã€ƒ).  I edit text files during the week for a living and make plushies during the weekends.  I really enjoy the process of creating things and having that final product bring joy to their owners. 

Please don't hesitate to message me if you have a character that you would like me to bring to life!
